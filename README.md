as those are the only relevant projects i did till now to the topics data science and web develpment.. i have downloaded only 2 projects: capstone and ai course project.

the capstone was a website including a machine learning part using supervised ml.

the ai course project was a machine learning project using unsupervised ml.

-> all folders are a part of the capstone project as i couldn't download it fully because it was too big in size.

-> the 2 python files are standalones of the capstone and ai course projects.
